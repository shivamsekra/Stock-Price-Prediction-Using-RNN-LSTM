# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-RNN-LSTM


The main aim of this project is that it will help and try to predict stock price and trends, that will ultimately help to lowering the market risk with help of comparison analysis of different ML and DL algorithms to create a successful model for stock prediction.
The main work of the project is to examine a number of different forecasting techniques to predict future stock returns based on past returns to successfully predict stock price changes and will compare different ML and DL models that can be used in prediction to find the best algorithm for prediction. 



GOALS:
•	Explore stock prices.
•	Implement basic model of linear regression.
•	Implement K-NN regression model.
•	Implement LSTM(RNN) model.
•	Compare the results and submit the project.

CONCLUSION

LSTM (RNN) outperforms among all the 3 algorithms we used for comparison with a good RMSE score as LSTM is a one of a type of Neural Networks in which sequential data (Time-series Data) is handled giving good accuracy and prediction scores as we observed in this project.
So, we conclude that we cant predict exact stock prices but we can achieve some good accuracy and for that Deep Neural network (LSTM) model is best suited. Also, similar kind of prediction like sales Prediction and forecasting can also be successfully done using LSTM models which would in-turn give better results than other simple regression algorithms which are available in Machine learning.
